# predicting-avg-debt
In this project, the goal is to predict the average amount of debt using multivariate regression models. To do so, we are given several features describing a credit card owner's profile such as demographics variables (education level, age, gender, ethnicity..) or financial information (credit limit, credit rating, number of credit cards..).

The project is divided into sections based on a machine learning workflow from Data Exploration to Model Interpretation.
